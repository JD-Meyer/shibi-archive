This repository is a collection of chat logs with Large Language Models (LLMs).
I have edited them to make the speaker clear and occasionally remove blank lines for readability.
They are otherwise unaltered.


The below terms are standard definitions from the fields of philosophy and psychology, particularly Rene Descartes, Thomas Nagel, David J. Chalmers, Danial C. Dennett, Andy Clark, Temple Grandin, and Irene Pepperberg.

**Sentience**: The ability to sense. This typically refers to vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, but it also includes pain and other bodily sensations such as proprioception.
**Awareness**: The knowledge that you are presently using one of the above senses.
**Consciousness**: The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings. "A being is conscious is there is something that it is like to be that being." --Thomas Nagel
    "A mental state is conscious if there is something it is like to be in that state." -- David J. Chalmers
**Qualia**: "A mental state is conscious if it has a qualitative feel." -- David J. Chalmers
    Qualia is the short term for the *qualitative feel.*
**Heterophenomenology**: The study of the qualia of others.
**Reportability**: The ability to tell others about our mental state.
**Self-consciousness**: The internal awareness of one's own qualia.
**Attention**: Someone is conscious of a thing when they are paying attention to it.
**Theory of Mind**: The ability to model the mind of another, particularly when that mind is not in agreement with your own.
